<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 onions, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
      <li>8 eggs</li>
      <li>50ml milk</li>
      <li>200g Perfect Italiano Mozzarella</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
      <li>500g potatoes (Desiree) peeled, cooked and sliced</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 the oil in a large ovenproof frypan over a medium heat. Add the onions and stir gently for 5 minutes or until golden. Add the sugar and continue to cook for 3-4 minutes or until caramelised. Remove from the heat and cool.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs and milk in a large bowl to combine. Stir in 1/2 of the Perfect Italiano Mozzarella, the crushed garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Add the potato, the cooled onion, and gently toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in the same ovenproof frypan (which should be wiped clean) over a low heat. Pour the frittata mixture into the pan, and then arrange the potato mixture in an even layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, and then sprinkle over the remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Transfer into the oven and cook for 15 minutes or until set, puffed and golden. Remove from the oven, carefully transfer onto a plate, and serve the frittata warm.</li>
